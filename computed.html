    <p>
        Template expressions are really for small sections of logic. 
        Anything larger can go into a computed property.
    </p>
    <div id="example1">
        <p>Original message: {{ message }}</p>
        <p>Computed reversed message: {{ reversedMessage }}</p>
        <p>Ugly reversed: {{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}</p>
        <p>Another computed change:  {{ revshed }}</p>
        <p>These computed properties will update when the data they depend on updates too.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="example2">
        <p>There is also methods: {{ messag }}  - {{ revMes() }}</p>
        <p> 
            However computed properties will only run on a dependency update,
            whereas a method runs on every re-render.
            So an expensive computation would be good for a computed property,
            where it wouldnt be ran unnecessarily. Anything else could use a method.
        </p>
    </div>    

    <div id="example3">
        <p>A more generic way to watch and react to data is watch properties.</p>
        <div id="demo">{{ fullName }}</div>
        <div id="demo2">{{ fullName }}</div>
        <p>The above are two seperate Vues, however the second uses a computed property
            while the first is using two watch properties. Second is better.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="example4">
        <p>Computed properties are by default getter-only. 
            However set can be used in a computed property. </p>
        <p>
            {{ fullName }}
        </p>    

    </div>

    <div id="example5">
        <p>
            Watchers - Most useful when you want to perform asynchronous
            or expensive operations in response to changing data. 
        </p>
        <div id="watch-example" style="margin-left: 15px;">
            <p>
              Ask a yes/no question:
              <input v-model="question">
            </p>
            <p>Response:: {{ answer }}</p>
            <p>Using watch here allows us to perform an async operation
                (API call), limit how many times it can be called and handle
                states until we get the reply. This wouldnt be possible with
                a computed property.
