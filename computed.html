    <p>
        Template expressions are really for small sections of logic. 
        Anything larger can go into a computed property.
    </p>
    <div id="example1">
        <p>Original message: {{ message }}</p>
        <p>Computed reversed message: {{ reversedMessage }}</p>
        <p>Ugly reversed: {{ message.split('').reverse().join('') }}</p>
        <p>Another computed change:  {{ revshed }}</p>
        <p>These computed properties will update when the data they depend on updates too.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="example2">
        <p>There is also methods: {{ messag }}  - {{ revMes() }}</p>
        <p> 
            However computed properties will only run on a dependency update,
            whereas a method runs on every re-render.
            So an expensive computation would be good for a computed property,
            where it wouldnt be ran unnecessarily. Anything else could use a method.
        </p>
    </div>    

    <div id="example3">
        <p>A more generic way to watch and react to data is watch properties.</p>
        <div id="demo">{{ fullName }}</div>
        <div id="demo2">{{ fullName }}</div>
        <p>The above are two seperate Vues, however the second uses a computed property
            while the first is using two watch properties. Second is better.
        </p>
        
        
    </div>
